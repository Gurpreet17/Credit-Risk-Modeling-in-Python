üè¶ Credit Risk Modeling in Python
This repository contains my work from the Credit Risk Modeling in Python course ‚Äî a hands-on program that explores how banks use data science to assess and manage credit risk.

The course focuses on modeling all three components of the expected credit loss equation:

Probability of Default (PD)

Loss Given Default (LGD)

Exposure at Default (EAD)

We worked with real-world data to build end-to-end models that are Basel II and III compliant, using techniques actually applied in the banking industry.

üîç Topics Covered:
Weight of Evidence (WoE) & Information Value (IV)

Fine & Coarse Classing

Logistic & Linear Regression

Model Metrics: AUC, ROC, Gini, KS

Scorecard Development

Population Stability Index (PSI)

Model Maintenance & Monitoring

The course was taught by an experienced PhD instructor and provided a strong foundation in both theory and practice. This repo showcases my implementation of the full modeling pipeline in Python.
